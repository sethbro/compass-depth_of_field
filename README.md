Effect wherein hovering over a "foreground" element causes the "background" to blur, & vice versa.
**Demo:** http://sethbro.com

## Usage
Apply the mixin to a container class with two children elements. These will be the "fields."
You'll most likely want to position the two elements relative to each other in a way that
supports the illusion. Javascript to add a [parallax scrolling effect](http://dev.jonraasch.com/scrolling-parallax/docs) is also helpful.

## TODO
* Support for 3+ field levels
* Support for sub-elements (links within text, etc)
